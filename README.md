Everybody liked this (ELT) is a super simple system-agnostic module that adds a window to the top left corner, which allows the user to react to other users' actions similar to the NPCs in populer CRPGs like Baldur's Gate 3 or Fallout.

Once you install the module you have to do nothing. It works out of the box.

Socketlib is required.
